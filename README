# Slick Playwright Automation Test

End-to-end tests for the Slick Salon staging application using Playwright with TypeScript and Page Object Model.

# Test Coverage

1. Verify user is able to login to the system successfully
2. Verify user is able to create a new appointment successfully
3. Verify user is NOT able to save a new client without mandatory fields validation

## Project Structure

```
├── pages/
│   ├── LoginPage.ts        # Email login + PIN entry
│   └── DashboardPage.ts    # User actions
├── tests/
│   └── dashboard.spec.ts   # Tests
├── .env                    # Credentials (not committed)
├── .gitignore
├── playwright.config.ts
└── package.json
```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/shalfern/playwright-automation.git
   cd playwright-automation

2. Install dependencies
   npm install

3. Install Playwright browsers
   npx playwright install

4. Create `.env` file
    .env

   Then update `.env` with your staging credentials:
   ```
   LOGIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   LOGIN_PASSWORD=your-password
   LOGIN_PIN=0000

## Run Tests

   npx playwright test tests/dashboard.spec.ts --headed

## Notes

- Tests run in **serial mode** — login happens once in `beforeAll`, then all tests share the same browser session
- The app uses custom React components that require `evaluate` clicks instead of standard Playwright `.click()` in some cases
- Tests use wait methods to slow down when run on browser mode for visibility
